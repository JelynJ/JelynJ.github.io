<h2>Exploring the Impact of Exercise Duration on Physiological and Well-being Indicators: Analyzing Trends in Post-Workout Soreness, Wake-Up Feelings, and Heart Rate Dynamics</h2>
<section>
    <strong>Exercise Duration Interaction</strong>:
    When the 'Exercise Duration' button is activated, the chart will focus solely on displaying data associated with
    'Peak Heart Rate' and 'Next Day Post Workout Soreness'. In this mode, users can engage with the chart by clicking on
    a desired segment within the outer circle. This action prompts the pointer to shift to the clicked interval,
    effectively highlighting this particular module. This interaction allows for an in-depth examination of the
    relationship between exercise duration and its subsequent physiological impacts.
<br>
    <strong>Time To Fall Asleep Interaction</strong>:
    Upon selecting the 'Time To Fall Asleep' button, the chart adjusts to show only the data relevant to 'Average
    Resting Heart Rate' and 'Wake Up Feeling'. Users can then interact by clicking on a specific interval on the inner
    circle, which corresponds to the 'Time To Fall Asleep' data. The pointer on the chart moves to this selected
    segment, drawing attention and highlighting this specific module. This feature enables users to closely analyze how
    the time taken to fall asleep correlates with changes in resting heart rate and feelings upon waking.

<section>
<p> <strong>Hypothesis</strong>:
        As exercise duration decreases, peak heart rate decreases, and post-workout soreness the next day decreases. In additionally,
        As the time to fall asleep decreases, average resting heart rate increases, and the feeling of tiredness upon waking up increases.

    <h2>Data Collection Overview</h2>
    <p >All the data was collected once per day over a period of 31 days</p>

    <h3>Objective Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Number of Course-Related Tasks: Academic task volume and sleep quality. Units: Number of tasks.</li>
        <li>Duration of Exercise: Physical activity effect on sleep. Units: Minutes.</li>
        <li>Daily Peak Heart Rate: Daily physical exertion. Units: BPM.</li>
        <li>Duration of Deep Sleep: Sleep quality measurement. Units: Hours and minutes.</li>
        <li>Wake-up Time: Impact of wake-up time on sleep. Units: Time.</li>
        <li>Time Taken to Fall Asleep: Sleep onset time effect. Units: Minutes.</li>
        <li>Duration of REM Sleep: Sleep structure evaluation. Units: Hours and minutes.</li>
        <li>Time Spent on Homework: Academic engagement and sleep. Units: Hours and minutes.</li>
        <li>Daily Average Resting Heart Rate: Cardiovascular health gauge. Units: BPM.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Subjective Data and Scales</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Overall Feeling Upon Waking: Restfulness assessment. Scale: 0 (Very Tired) to 5 (Very Refreshed).</li>
        <li>Appetite Upon Full Wakefulness: Morning hunger levels. Scale: 0 (Not Hungry) to 5 (Extremely Hungry).</li>
        <li>Post-Exercise Bodily Pain: Comfort after exercise. Scale: 0 (No Pain) to 5 (Severe Pain).</li>
    </ul>

    In conclusion, the data and visualizations from this project suggest a complex interplay between exercise duration
    and various physiological and subjective well-being metrics. The observed direct and inverse relationships indicate
    that longer exercise sessions can lead to increased tiredness and soreness, while shorter sleep onset times might be
    linked to greater fatigue. This partially supports the hypothesis that increased physical activity leads to more
    pronounced post-exercise tiredness, but it also highlights an unexpected relationship between sleep onset time and
    tiredness upon waking. An alternative hypothesis could explore whether the intensity, rather than the duration of
    exercise, is a more significant factor in influencing post-exercise soreness and overall well-being. Future studies
    could benefit from collecting data on exercise intensity, types of physical activities, and their specific impact
    on heart rate and subjective feelings of tiredness, to further clarify these relationships.
